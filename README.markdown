## What is passchain?

passchain is a small python script that reads a list of passwords, builds
something that resembles a markov model from it and can then be invoked to spit
out realistically looking passwords.

## Useful?

* generate reasonable passwords for testing of your login/signup/hash/salt
  process.

* use it for *legal* pentesting to see if some users just put a twist on a
  common password.

## License?

3-clause BSD. See the file ``LICENSE`` for details.
